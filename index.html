  <p> Before we can delve further into what Creole is, we first create a definition for culture. At its simplest form, culture can simply be described as the way of life of a people. Our culture is in our very blood and encompasses every part of our lives; from the food we eat, the way we dance,the clothes we wear and even the languages we speak. To Saint Lucians, our fellow Dominican brothers and sisters to the north and the wider Creole community our culture was born out of hardship and struggle. </p>
  <p> To understand creole, we must understand the history from which it was born. Many, many years ago, during the height of colonialism the French and British fought eagerly over the island of Saint Lucia due to the prospective wealth that could be mined from our small island.</p>
  <p class = "Three"> “Seven times British, seven times French. </p>
  <p class = "Three">  They battled for this land. </p>
  <p class = "Three">  A land that’s blessed with nature’s best. </p>
  <p class = "Three">  This Helen of the West.” </p>
  <p> As the popular song goes, we changed hands seven times between 1664 and 1803 as St. Lucia had been deemed the Helen of the West, a creative play on the Helen of Troy, a beautiful Greek maiden thought so beautiful that war was waged for her hand.</p>

    <p class = "One"> We are concerned with the slow death of Saint Lucian Creole, a language born from the pain and hardship of our ancestors. While some modern muscians have taken up the mantle by  the use of the language in their music, we believe that it is time for other groups to step up and do our part. Without intervention, the next few generations might never be able to understand the beauty and intricacy of the language aside from the most common of phrases. </p>
  <h4 class = "Two"> Mission Statement </h4>
    <p class = "One"> Our brand is dedicated towards the preservation and celebration of Saint Lucia, of our people, our past and our future. We are dedicated towards modernizing and poularizing madras, a staple point in any Creole celebration which typically returns to the public eye before October and bows out only a month later. We believe that Creole shouldn't simply be a month of celebrations, it is a lifestyle and a part of our cultural identity that deserves more than just one dedicated month each year. As a company, we are also committed to ensuring that the language grows in fluent speakers who are capable of not only speaking the language but also being able to read and write it, a feat which as of the moment few are able to do. We are open to all, young and old, male and female, locals and tourists, no one shall be turned away from our doors. We will do our best to ensure the continued growth and prosperity of Saint Lucian Creole and the rest of our culture. </p>
