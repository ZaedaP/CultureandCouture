  <h4 class = "Two"> Problem Statement </h4>
  <div class ="Two>"
    <p class = "One"> We are concerned with the slow death of Saint Lucian Creole, a language born from the pain and hardship of our ancestors. While some modern muscians have taken up the mantle by  the use of the language in their music, we believe that it is time for other groups to step up and do our part. Without intervention, the next few generations might never be able to understand the beauty and intricacy of the language aside from the most common of phrases. </p>
  <h4 class = "Two"> Mission Statement </h4>
    <p class = "One"> Our brand is dedicated towards the preservation and celebration of Saint Lucia, of our people, our past and our future. We are dedicated towards modernizing and poularizing madras, a staple point in any Creole celebration which typically returns to the public eye before October and bows out only a month later. We believe that Creole shouldn't simply be a month of celebrations, it is a lifestyle and a part of our cultural identity that deserves more than just one dedicated month each year. As a company, we are also committed to ensuring that the language grows in fluent speakers who are capable of not only speaking the language but also being able to read and write it, a feat which as of the moment few are able to do. We are open to all, young and old, male and female, locals and tourists, no one shall be turned away from our doors. We will do our best to ensure the continued growth and prosperity of Saint Lucian Creole and the rest of our culture. </p>
