<p class = "One"> Below we have the Wob Dwiyet, one of the national dresses of St. Lucia which is typically only worn around Creole Heritage Month in October. Historians say that the dress originated from similiar designs that were popular in then 18th, century France.

<p class = "One"> Our second national dress is the Madras, also known as the Jip or Jupe. It was born of the Wob Dwiyet and is named after the Madras, the colorful fabric used in its design. The madras we were today is near identical to other traditional outfits used in the former French colonies of Dominica, Guadeloupe and Martinique. During October, it would be nigh impossible to walk down a street without seeing a hint of Madras in either skirts, dresses, shirts and now even cloth masks. </p>

<p class = "One"> Our aim is to bring a fresh look to Saint Lucian fashion with a few of our top designs shown below. The profit I earn will be going back to the community to create classes to teach Saint Lucian Creole as well as other resources such as dictionaries, phrase books, textbooks and workbooks. </p>
