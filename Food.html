<h1> The Language </h1>

It would truly be remiss of me, to mention Creole without showing off some of our culinary delights. We have a large assortment of local delicacies, many of which are only served during October, the month dedicated to Creole Heritage.

<h3> Salt Fish and Green Bananas </h3>
<img src = "Salt2.jpg" alt = "Photo of a Food" id = "HeaderPic">
<p class = "One"> This is our national dish and it has become a staple for many households across St. Lucia. This dish originated in the 19th century during the height of slavery. St. Lucia was well known for its 'green gold'and as such it was in abundance on the island while we were able to import saltfish quite cheaply from Canada. It was passed down from generation to generation until it became recognized as the island's national dish. </p>

<h3> Pepper Pot or One Pot </h3>
<img src = "OnePot.jpg" alt = "Photo of a Food" id = "HeaderPic">
<p class = "One"> These are traditional stews which are created with whatever is left over in the cupboards. It is comprised of meats, herbs and fresh vegetables. </p>

<h3> Accra or Fish Cakes </h3>
<img src = "Foo.jpg" alt = "Photo of a Food" id = "HeaderPic">
<p class = "One">These are created with saltfish, mixed with various spices and then fried. They are crow favorite delicacy at any Creole event and typically during the rest of the year at Wakes, which is our way of honoring the deceased. Wakes are essentially large parties held after the funeral, where friends, family and aquaintances can come together one last time to honor the dead. </p>

<h3> Breadfruit </h3>
  <img src = "BreadFruit.jpg" alt = "Photo of a Food" id = "HeaderPic">
<p class = "One"> This is one of the most versatile and well hidden secrets of the fruit world. This can be boiled, fried, made into a salad, served with saltfsih, other salted meats, stewed pork, fried or roast fish and just sprinkled with some coconut oil. </p>

<h3> Callalloo Soup or Bouillion </h3>
<img src = "Bou.jpg" alt = "Photo of a Food" id = "HeaderPic">
<p class = "One">This meal can be found up and down the West Indian Archipelago as it was our common ancestors, the West Africans who brought this dish over with them. It is made from the leaves of a callalloo, combined with dumplings, salted meat, lentils or red beans and some people even throw in lobster, conch or crab mean. </p>
