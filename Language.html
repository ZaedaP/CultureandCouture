<h1> The Language </h1>
<img src = "IshMwen.jpg" alt = "Photo of a Baby" id = "HeaderPic">
<p class = "One"> The language was birthed as a half way point between the French and English spoken by the then colonizers and the various native tongues spoken by the slaves who had been brought in via ship. In order to communicate with each other and their white slave masters, the enslaved created their own language, just one show of the strength of our African ancestors. The language has always faced an upward battle and even now it struggles to gain a proper foothold in St. Lucian education. Historically, Creole was associated with slavery and after the abolition of that Creole system it has become associated with a lack of education and a very low social status. </p>

<p class = "One"> Many of our grandparents, parents and older relatives refused to teach the language to the younger generation as they believed that Standard English alone could be the language of social mobility. Historically speaking, Creole was spoken in every corner of St. Lucia, from the bustling seaside village of Laborie to the growing capital of then Soufriere. As time progressed and the island began to develop, children born in more urban areas such as our current capital Castries were not taught the language. For those who do speak Creole, it is limited to private conversations, provocative music and folklore which becomes more popular during Creole heritage month.</p>

<p class = "One"> Many see French Creole as nothing more than broken French, a cheap imitation which has no place in settings like schools or the workplace. For most, Creole is primarily an oral language and as such very few are able to properly read and write the language. Creole is not taught or used in many official settings. Quite a few have fought and are still fighting to get Creole recognized more formally as a language and to be incorporated into the schools. As far back as 1986, research and policies have been presented for the standardization of the language, and their goal is just as mine is, to preserve our French  Creole and our culture. This is the main aim of this website, to bring awareness to a dying language which is intertwined so deeply in our culture, that to loose it would be to lose the very foundation of our people.</p>
