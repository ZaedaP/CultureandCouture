<h1 class = "Two"> Bonjour Tout Moun </h1>

<p class = "One"> I am a young adult who was born and raised in the south of Saint Lucia and I am the owner of Culture and Couture, a small boutique with aspirations of expanding within the next few years. Aside from the boutique, I am currently going through the rather rigourous process of college applications in order to further my current education. I opened this store in order to spread my admiration and love for Creole, the language in particular and all other facets of the culture, especially the clothing. The store was an inadvert creation of our current global pandemic.</p>
<p class = "One"> Typically, during the month of October which is deemed as Creole Heritage Month, the beauty of our heritage is abundant, spreading from the smallest of villages to the largest of towns, however our current global situation has placed a large damper on celebrations. The store is a reminder to our people, that our heritage can never be stopped, that our culture can never decline in importance and that our resilence is infinite. </p>
<p class = "One"> Growing up I particpated in all sorts of community activities, one of my favorite being our local Quadrile Dance Group which sadly broke up while I was still in primary school. While this particular dance group was not one I ever partipated in, our dances were similar and I wanted to share a bit of my childhood </p>
